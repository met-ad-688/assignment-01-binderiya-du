# Assignment-01
In Assignment 1 we did the following things:
   a. First we created and configured EC2 instances
   b. Then we connected to the EC2 instance via SSH and VS code
   c. After connecting to the EC2 virtual machine we created a remote Jupyter notebook server on the EC2 instance
   d. After going through the steps to connect and settle in the environment we learned how to use shell command to generate system and environment information
   e. After getting familiar with shell commands we wrote a shell script in nano that counts number of lines containing word python in a csv file
   f. And then by using python we wrote a script to count the lines containing the word github in the stack overflow post

The instructions on running the scripts:
a. In order to run the shell script that counts the number of lines with the word python in a csv file, first of all you need to make sure that the csv file is in the correct directory, and then you should type the following code in your terminal ./count_python.sh, after couple of seconds you will get the result in the terminal.
b. In order to run the script that counts the number of lines with github in a post, you need the _output folder in the assignment 1 repository, and open the file count_github.py and the run the script. This one will take a little longer but, after few minutes you will get your result in the terminal.
